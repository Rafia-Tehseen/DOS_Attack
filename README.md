# DOS_Attack
A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is a type of cyber attack in which an attacker tries to disrupt or temporarily disable a website, service, or network by overwhelming it with traffic or other types of data. The goal of a DoS attack is to render the targeted system unavailable to its users, causing inconvenience or financial damage to the owner of the system.

There are several types of DoS attacks, including:

    Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack: In this type of attack, the attacker uses a network of compromised computers (known as a botnet) to flood the targeted system with traffic or requests.

    ICMP flood attack: This attack involves sending a large number of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets to the targeted system, which can cause it to crash or become unresponsive.

    SYN flood attack: In this attack, the attacker sends a large number of SYN requests to the targeted system, which can cause it to become overwhelmed and unable to respond to legitimate requests.

    HTTP flood attack: This attack involves sending a large number of HTTP requests to the targeted system, which can cause it to become overloaded and unable to respond to legitimate requests.

There are several ways to prevent or mitigate the effects of a DoS attack, including:

    Installing and maintaining up-to-date anti-virus software and firewalls.
    Using intrusion detection and prevention systems to detect and block DoS attacks.
    Configuring servers and network devices to limit the impact of DoS attacks.
    Distributing resources across multiple servers or data centers to reduce the impact of an attack.
    Working with internet service providers (ISPs) to block traffic from known sources of attack.
    Implementing rate limiting and other traffic shaping techniques to mitigate the effects of an attack.
